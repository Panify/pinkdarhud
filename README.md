## A black/pink edit of a more modern take of the default hud

Regular in-game hud elements (such as health and ammo) are changed yet. I'll have to see if I like the way it looks if I get rid of the team color. Main menu, source scheme, and other elements have been changed. Mostly little things to replace tan with white.
